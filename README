PicardOS

This is my (very) basic toy operating system. At the moment I have only hacked
together pieces of various tutorials (referenced below) and the result is a 
kernel which can be boot, print to the tty and catch standard processor
exceptions.

I'm not currently putting any build instructions because getting a cross
compiler setup is more than I want to discuss in this documents.
